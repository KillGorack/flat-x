IT NEEDS TO BE FAST!<br><br>Sorta without an array, only the pagesize is crammed into an array, HOWEVER the entire file list has to be looked at two times.. almost 100ms.. (make it faster..)<br><br>No sorting with fields yet.. This would be TOO slow. Currently only latest files go to the top of the list (as written)...|*#*|active
